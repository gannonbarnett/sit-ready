Here are some tips:\n\n  -  To create a new race, click the plus, enter a race name and your name, and press \"Create Race.\"\n\n  -  To join an existing race, make sure you're connected to the internet, and enter the code you were given.\n\n  -  The spectator code will give people access to view the live race results, but not to record times.\n\n  -  The admin code will give people access to view and to record race results.\n\n  -  To record a race result, make sure your access level is \"Admin\" and press the \"Record Data\" button.\n\n  -  Make sure you are looking at the latest results by pressing the \"reload\" button.\n\n - If you would like to report a bug, please contact us using the link below."
